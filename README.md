âœ… Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

    Go to https://github.com

    Log in to your account.

    Click the + sign in the top right corner â†’ "New repository"

    Fill in:

        Repository name: (e.g., my-framework)

        Description: (optional)

        Public or Private

        Leave "Initialize with a README" unchecked.

    Click "Create repository"

âœ… Step 2: Open Terminal in Your Project Folder

Navigate to the root folder of your framework on your computer.

cd path/to/your/framework

âœ… Step 3: Initialize Git and Add Files

Run the following commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

âœ… Step 4: Link to GitHub and Push

From the GitHub page (after creating the repo), you'll see something like this:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-framework.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Copy-paste those commands in your terminal to link your local folder to GitHub and push the code.
âœ… Step 5: Done!

Now refresh your GitHub repository pageâ€”you should see your framework code uploaded ðŸŽ‰
